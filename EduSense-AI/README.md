# EduSense AI 🎓

A real-time AI-powered desktop application that detects and analyzes student emotions through a live camera feed — built as a graduation project.

## What It Does

EduSense AI uses your webcam to detect multiple students in a classroom and analyze their facial emotions in real time. The system identifies 7 emotions for each detected face simultaneously and displays live results through an interactive bar chart.
